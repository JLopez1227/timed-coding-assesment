# Timed Coding Assesment

## Description
In this week's homework we were tasked with making a short, multiple-choice, assessment that would challenge us to use HTML, CSS, and well as JavaScript code to create a functional and interactive quiz. I used HTML to layout the foundation of my application, creating Divs where necessary, as well as linking the CSS to the HTML which allows for the styling of the page. I used CSS to style the application, giving it a nice pop of color as well as centering all of the text. More importantly using the CSS to make the application look professional on both the Home Page as well as the High Scores Page. Using JavaScript code I was able to make the application functional and interactive the buttons work when clicked on, if you answer a question incorrectly time is deducted from your time left, and you can also save your High Scores!
